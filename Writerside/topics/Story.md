# Story

## Plot Summary
You play as an automaton, a machine created and powered by one of the very Vessels which were responsible for the mass destabilization event which wiped out a large chunk of humanity.
Automatons are used as soldiers, with their ability to use magic through their Vessels a last chance for humanity to fight against the monsters.

You're sent to the town of Claudus, a town which sits on the edge of the ruins of Vehemens, a once great city that was ravaged by monsters during the First Destabilization Event.
The city remains filled with monsters, only entered for material scouting which Claudus uses for trade.
However, recently, an uptick in monster activity in the area has led to concerns over a secondary destabilization of the remaining Vessels in the city,
which you have been sent in to investigate.

You must gain the trust of people in the town in order to get information to help you with your task,
as well as defeat monsters and explore the ruins of Vehemens to find the Vessels, and possibly find who is behind their rapid destabilization.

You slowly begin to work out that the destabilization is called by a cult called Finum,
a group of humans living both in the town and the ruins who aim to use the power of the Vessels to cause the end of the world.

## Branching Paths - Player Choices
1. You stop the cult - you manage to work out the cause of the destabilization of the Vessels and stop the cult from progressing with their plan.
   Humanity continues with the population stabilizing under the watch of automatons, which have begun to go into wider production.
2. The second destabilization event - the cult wins, and you are unable to stop the destabilization event.
   There are multiple points where this ending can be reached, with the ending cards reading differently depending on the player's actions.
   Throughout the game, there will be moments where the player is tested. Should the worst come to pass, the cult will win,
   the world will end and the soul program will be activated.


## Player Character
The player controls a Vita type automaton.
Vita is a Vessel powered automaton. It was created to battle monsters through the powers given by the Vessel and, as a side effect,
keeping its own Vessel stable with Seri.

Vita is one of the first successful automata created, whilst also being one of the most powerful due to the size of Vessel contained within.
They are the prototype model for the generation of automata that came after, it was created by the inventor of automatas.
Though their memory has been wiped since the inventor's death, they contain a secret program that would be activated if humanity is wiped out.
This program gives automatas the final component that prevents them from being 'human', it gives them a 'soul'.

Vita is goal-oriented, planning solely to complete its tasks, as a result, it can often come off as blunt.
It's quick thinking and the ability to problem-solve are the reasons it's sent on investigatory or reconnaissance missions into areas of high risk.

## The Cult of Finum
The Finum are a cult residing within the ruins of Vehemens and Claudus.
They are the ones responsible for the Second Destabilization Event, by trying to harness the power left in Vessels.
They have caused them to begin to destabilize again, causing an increase in monsters.
The Finum wants to end humanity, seeing it as the easy way out of the suffering and poverty of the population as it continues to decline.

## The Destabilization Event
There was a time when monster numbers had dwindled and humanity prospered.
People began building towns and cities around stones they called 'Vessels' which were believed to bring luck and prosperity.
Eventually, research into these Vessels began, hoping to discover their secrets.
This research, however, became humanities downfall - they were not prepared for what was to come.

At the beginning of the millennium, one of the Vessels began to destabilize due to experimentation, leaking power at an unprecedented rate.
This caused a chain reaction, destabilizing Vessels across the world.

The monsters, drawn to the Vessels' power, quickly overran towns and cities, wiping out a large chunk of the population,
leaving many settlements destroyed. Monster numbers increased rapidly, with monsters closer to Vessels gaining further power.

## The Creation of Project Erithacus
The remaining humans began trying to find a way to re-stabilize the Vessels as soon as possible, to bring an end to the destruction.
Monster hunting became a necessity, which would not be possible without magic supplied from Vessels.
Humanities last ditch effort to create a solution was the automaton.
Powered by a Vessel the automaton could channel Seri which would enable humanity to fight monsters without human loses.
As an accidental stroke of genius, the automaton could stabilize Vessels with Seri they wield.

The first few experiments ended in almost-catastrophic failure, with the Vessels powering the automatons destabilizing.
The first working automaton, codenamed Vita, came almost too late, after many more loses to the monsters.
With a working prototype, Project Erithacus began, tasked with producing more automata which could protect settlements from monsters.

## The Creation of the Soul Program
Automatons were created largely to act as humans, as a result, they only mimic being a human.
The Soul Program was created by the original inventor, installed to Vita in secret.
There was a popular belief amongst scientists that humanity would not live much longer;
this sentiment was held by the inventor and so work on a program to create a 'soul' was started.
The program would cause automatons to feel as humans do - they would gain the software equivalent of a soul.

The Soul Program existed to carry on humanities legacy, should humans become extinct.
It was created in secret as a fail-safe, to be activated only if humanity was wiped out.
If a Second Destabilization Event came to pass, and the extinction of humanity, the program would activate and spread to other automatons.
